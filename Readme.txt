Purpose  Comparing video quality of multiple video files.
Reason   When downloading movies/series I often compare the quality/size of the videos to decide which one to download/keep on disk.
         This makes that process much faster, easier and more accurate.
How to use
         Run main
         Select at least 2 Files (click cancel button if you are done selecting)
         Choose how many images you wish to take to compare quality
         Wait while screencaps are taken
         Select the best image per group of images (click image to see other image)
         When the result show up you can decide which file you wish to keep/delete/download rest of the torrent,....
Notes    Does not support all file formats (2 sample files are provided in "/samples").
         Java 8 features (lambdas, streams) are used for learning, not readability or performance.
